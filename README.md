# HMS Harmful Brain Activity Classification

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Kaggle competition "HMS Harmful Brain Activity Classification.<br>
" The goal of this competition is to develop machine learning models that can identify harmful brain activity patterns from EEG data.<br>
This challenge aims to push forward the field of neuroinformatics and contribute to health informatics by automating the detection of harmful brain activity, potentially improving patient outcomes in clinical settings."<br>

## Competition Data
The dataset provided by the competition consists of EEG and spectrogram recordings from multiple subjects. Each recording is labeled ass differnt illness,<br>
based on the presence of specific brain activity patterns deemed harmful.<br>
Participants are expected to use this data to train models capable of accurately classifying unseen recordings.<br>

### Data Structure
- `/data/raw/`: Contains the raw EEG and spectrogram data files downloaded from the competition page.
can be downloaded from [link for kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/data)  <br>
[npy file for all spectrogram for faster load of spectrograms](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdeotte/brain-spectrograms) <br>

## Installation
To set up your environment to run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.TBD.
3. Install the required Python TBD packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis and model training:

1. Navigate to the notebooks directory.TBD
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks(preferabley google colab because of data size and faster reload) in order. indicating its order in the workflow.TBD

## Model Training and Evaluation
TBD

### Running the Models
